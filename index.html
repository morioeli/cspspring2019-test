<a href= https://genius.com/Mr-probz-waves-lyrics > [Verse]
<p>My face above the water
<p>My feet can't touch the ground
<p>Touch the ground, and it feels like
<p>I can see the sands on the horizon
<p>Everytime you are not around</a>
<p>
[Hook]
<p>I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
<p>Wave after wave, wave after wave
<p>I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
<p>And it feels like I'm drowning
<p>Pulling against the stream
<p>Pulling against the stream
<p>
[Verse]
<p>I wish I could make it easy
<p>Easy to love me, love me
<p>But still I reach, to find a way
<p>I'm stuck here in between
<p>I'm looking for the right words to say
<p>
[Hook]
<p>I'm slowly drifting, drifting away
<p>Wave after wave, wave after wave
<p>I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
<p>And it feels like I'm drowning
<p>Pulling against the stream
<p>Pulling against the stream
